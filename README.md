## Backend Integration

This project is tied to a backend repository that handles all server-side logic, including URL shortening, analytics tracking, and authentication.  
You **must** download and set up the backend repository to fully utilize URLess.

### Backend Repository:

[URL Shortener Backend Repository](https://github.com/IsaiasMalvar/url-shortener-backend.git)

### Setting Up the Backend:

1. Clone the backend repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IsaiasMalvar/url-shortener-backend.git
   cd url-shortener-backend
   ```

2. Follow the instructions in the backend repositoryâ€™s README to set up the server and database.

3. Once the backend is running, make sure to use its URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8080`) in your **URLess frontend** `.env` file (see the installation section below).
